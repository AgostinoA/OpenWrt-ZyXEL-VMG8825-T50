menuconfig GENERIC_PWM
	tristate "PWM Support"
	depends on SYSFS
	help
	  This enables PWM support through the generic PWM library.
	  If unsure, say N.

if GENERIC_PWM

config ATMEL_PWM
	tristate "Atmel AT32/AT91 PWM support"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for the PWMC
	  peripheral channels found on certain Atmel processors.
	  Pulse Width Modulation is used many for purposes, including
	  software controlled power-efficient backlights on LCD
	  displays, motor control, and waveform generation.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config GPIO_PWM
       tristate "PWM emulation using GPIO"
       help
         This option enables a single-channel PWM device using
	 a kernel interval timer and a GPIO pin.  If unsure, say N.
